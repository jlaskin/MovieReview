For HW10 I added hide/unhide functionality using JavaScript.  In the Users Index (the page accessed by clicking "view users" from the home page), when you click on an individual user, the default behavior is to show the first 5 (up to 5) recommendations made by that user in alphabetical order.  I added a button which hides/unhides those recommendations.
