For HW6: I added Devise to my app, and cleaned up some of the design of the page by adding a navbar.

I had an issue with the login/logout feature causing massive errors, which is why this is late (I had to meet with Jenny to resolve it), even though it ultimately was caused by a single link needing to be changed to a button.  Jenny said I shouldn't lose points for that.
